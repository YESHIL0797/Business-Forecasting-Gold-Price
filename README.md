Usage:

To use the model, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the gold-price-prediction.R file in R Studio.
3. Set the working directory to the location of the file using the setwd() function.
4. Run the code in the file to train and evaluate the model.
5. Use the predict() function to make forecasts of gold prices using the trained model.

Data
The data used to train and evaluate the model is contained in the 1979-2021.csv file in the data directory. This file contains gold price data for the period from January 31, 1979 to July 31, 2021.

Results
The model achieved an accuracy of XX% on the training set and XX% on the test set.
